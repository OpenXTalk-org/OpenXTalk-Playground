# OpenXTalk-Playground
OpenXTalkPlayground

This repo is for use as an xTalk and JavaScript playground on the web.
It runs on the OpenXTalk Emscripten engine, which is currently a hefty download (about 28mb).
Currently this includes some examples of transfering data in and out its outer HTML page and other tests included.
