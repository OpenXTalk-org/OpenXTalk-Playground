The OpenXTalk CoreMIDI library extension is a Foreign Function Interface wrapper for Apple's CoreMIDI API for communication with it's MIDI Server on macOS systems (could likely be enhanced to work on iOS devices). OXT out to CoreMIDI-out works very well. MIDI-in from CoreMIDI is crash-prone and needs additional development work done. Note that the FluidSynth Library also provides CoreMIDI in/out on macOS (and is not quite as crash-prone with MIDI in).
