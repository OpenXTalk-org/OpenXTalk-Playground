The OpenXTalk CoreMIDI library extension is a Foreign Function Interface wrapper for Apple's CoreMIDI API for communication with it's MIDI Server on macOS systems (could likely be enhanced to work on iOS devices). MIDI out works from OXT works well, but MIDI-in is crash-prone and needs additional development work done.
